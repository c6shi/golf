    <p>Observe that Round 1 and Round 2 scores are in general better than Round 3 and Round 4 score across all players. This makes sense, as these players are those who made the cut and would have had to played well in the first two rounds. Additionally, we see that the field is primarily composed of American players, and players representing English-speaking countries (namely, the U.S., Canada, Ireland, England, Scotland, Northern Ireland, South Africa, and Australia). This also makes sense since the U.S. Open is a USGA event and is on the official schedules of the PGA Tour and the European Tour. Finally, we see that the University of Georgia, Arizona State University, UNLV, and University of Texas have produced the most players in the field.</p>
